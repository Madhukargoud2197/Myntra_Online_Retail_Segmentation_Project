        "### **Approach:**\n",
        "The Steps followed to acheive the objective of this project are as follows:\n",

        "###  **Exploratory Data Analysis:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Exploratory data analysis was performed on the dataset to understand the data distribution, perform data inspection and identify missing values, and outliers.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Data preprocessing:**\n",
        "\n",
        "The dataset is then preprocessed by removing irrelevant columns, handling missing values, and scaling the features.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Implementing Machine Learning Models**\n",
        "\n",
        "**K-means clustering:**\n",
        "\n",
        "K-means clustering algorithm was implemented to group the customers into K clusters based on their buying behavior. The optimal value of K was selected using the Elbow method and Silhouette score.\n",
        "In this project, it was found that the optimal number of clusters was 2.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**Hierarchical clustering:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Hierarchical clustering algorithm was implemented to group the customers based on their similarity in buying behavior. The Dendrogram was used to select the optimal number of clusters. In this project, the optimal number of clusters was found to be 2.\n",
        "\n",
        "**DBSCAN:**\n",
        "\n",
        "DBSCAN clustering algorithm was implemented to group the customers based on their density of buying behavior. The optimal values of Eps and min_samples were selected using the elbow method.\n",

        "\n",
        "**Results:**\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "The results of the project showed that customer segmentation using unsupervised machine learning algorithms can be a powerful tool for businesses to understand their customers' behavior and target them with appropriate marketing strategies. The project identified two distinct groups of customers based on their buying behavior and suggested appropriate marketing strategies to target each group.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Conclusion:**\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "In conclusion, the project successfully implemented K-means clustering, hierarchical clustering, and DBSCAN machine learning algorithms to perform customer segmentation. The project's results demonstrate the effectiveness of unsupervised machine learning algorithms in customer segmentation, which can help businesses improve their marketing strategies and increase their sales. Additionally, the project found that there were two clusters that could effectively group the customers based on their buying behavior.\n"

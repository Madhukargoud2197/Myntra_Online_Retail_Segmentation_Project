# Online_Retail_Customer_Segmentation_Project
## Description
This project focuses on performing customer segmentation for an online retail business. By applying various clustering techniques to the customer data, we aim to identify distinct customer segments based on their purchasing behavior, preferences, and demographics. This segmentation analysis can provide valuable insights for targeted marketing strategies, personalized recommendations, and improved customer satisfaction.

## Features
* Utilized K-means clustering algorithm with silhouette score evaluation for optimal cluster count determination.
* Applied K-means clustering with the elbow method to identify the ideal number of clusters using within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS).
* Implemented Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering to analyze hierarchical relationships among customer segments.
* Incorporated DBSCAN algorithm for identifying dense regions in the data and handling noisy data points effectively.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project was provided by Almabetter. It contains transactional data from an online retail store, including essential attributes such as customer IDs, InvoiceNo, StockCode, Description, Quantity, InvoiceDate, UnitPrice and Country. This rich dataset enabled robust analysis and accurate customer segmentation.

## Importance of Customer Segmentation
Customer segmentation plays a pivotal role in empowering businesses to understand their clients on a deeper level. By discerning different customer groups based on behavior, demographics, and other relevant factors, businesses can optimize their marketing efforts, enhance client understanding, and drive revenue growth.

## RFM Model for Customer Value Assessment
To effectively segment customers in the online retail industry, I employed the renowned Recency-Frequency-Monetary (RFM) model. This model assigns quantitative values to customers based on three key dimensions: recency of their last purchase, frequency of their transactions, and monetary value of their purchases. By analyzing these metrics, high-value customers who frequently purchase high-value products can be identified.

## Approach and Methodology
Throughout the project, I followed a systematic approach, encompassing the following steps:

1. **Data Inspection:** Thoroughly reviewing the dataset for any missing or duplicate values to ensure data integrity.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conducting comprehensive data exploration and visualization techniques to gain meaningful insights into customer behavior, including purchase patterns, popular transaction days, and time preferences.
3. **Data Preparation:** Performing data cleaning, addressing inconsistencies or outliers, and transforming variables when necessary to ensure accurate analysis.
4. **RFM Model Creation:** Creating a robust RFM model by assigning scores to customers based on their recency, frequency, and monetary value.
5. **Implementing Clustering Models:** Applying advanced clustering algorithms, including K-Means Clustering, Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering, and DBSCAN, to segment customers into distinct groups.
6. **Validation and Conclusion:** Validating the clustering results and drawing insightful conclusions from the identified customer segments. These findings can guide targeted marketing strategies, improve customer satisfaction, and drive business growth.

## Conclusion
In this project i have applied unsupervised machine learning techniques to segment online retail customers vased on their purchasing behaviour, uncovering distinct groups with meaningful differences in transaction frequency, monetary value and engagement. These insights provide a foundation for targeted marketing strategies, personalized promotions and improved customer retention efforts. The approach demonstrates the value of data-driven segmentation in enhancing business performance and offers a scalable framework that can be extended with additional data sources and predictive modeling in future iterations.
